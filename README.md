# IntRec

### What is IntRec?

IntRec is a neural network that attempts to recognize handwritten digits with a high degree of accuracy. IntRec trained on the MNIST dataset of 60 000 28x28 handwritten grayscale digits. The program also provides a user interface for drawing digits to be interpreted by intRec.

This project is inspired by 3blue1brown, see https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/neural-networks.

Uses the MNIST dataset for handwritten labeled digits.

### Usage

To train the neural network, run the trainer.py file. The amount of tests, batches, batch size and amount of epochs can be configured in the trainer.py file. To use the drawing program, run the intRec.py file.
